# Blog API

A full-stack blogging platform built with modern web technologies, providing a seamless content management experience. This project implements a RESTful API with a clean, responsive frontend that allows users to create, read, and manage blog posts with ease. Built with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, the application features user authentication, post management, and an interactive commenting system.
